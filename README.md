# Human Resource Analytics-Kaggle-Dataset
## Authors - Ryan Nazareth and Hannes Draxl

A group project carried out on a dataset freely available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/d/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/hr-analytics 
Fields in the dataset include:

Employee satisfaction level
Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Department
Salary
Whether the employee has left

Trying to predict if the best and most experienced employees leave prematurely based on features listed above, using vanilla Neural Network techniques:

* SVM 
* Multi Layer Perceptron with Backpropagation 

The original dataset is stored in the 'KAggle Dataset' folder. The cleaned data and code is stored in the 'cleaned data' folder. All programming carried out in Matlab.

This work will also be ported into one of the open source deep learning frameworks - keras/tensor flow to run more sophistcated techniques not available in Matlab
